            <p class="preview-text">Honda has finally lunched its new bike in india with the price tag of 1.44 ex showroom. this will be first ever low cc adventure bike in india as well as in nepal. this bike might be available for test ride in september. as we can also guess this bike will be soon lunched in nepal, but price might be quite high in nepal beacuse of tax.As we all know few days ago hornet 2.0 was lunched with the price tag of 4 lakh 60 thausand . people were angry because it was expected to around 3 lakh 4 thousand to 3 lakh 60 thausand. so from the price of hornet 2.0 i guess price of Honda CB200X would be around 5 lakh in nepal.
